# Java-DS-Algo-Codes
This Repo is part of my Learning of Java. It includes all my codes including from basics of Java to important concepts of DS-Algo.
It has all the codes from basics sections like loops, break and continue statements in Java, arrays, strings, Fibonacci series. 
From the OOCP sections it has codes including classes and objects, methods, constructors, encapsulation, inheritance and many more.
Any suggestions and changes are welcome !!
