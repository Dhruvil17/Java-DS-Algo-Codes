# Java-DS-Algo-Codes
This Repo is part of my Learning of Java. It includes all my codes including from basics of Java to important concepts of DS-Algo.
It has all the codes from basics sections like loops, break and continue statements in Java, arrays, strings, Fibonacci series. 
From the OOCP sections it has codes including classes and objects, methods, constructors, encapsulation, inheritance and many more.

Now I have also added my code for implementation of Iterator Design Patten from Scratch. I developed a Iterator design pattern from scratch in Java.
Iterator pattern will work for String, Integer, Float, Double and other datatypes as well. 
Soon I will be adding the implementation of the Iterator Design Pattern for other Data Structures like Trees, Sets etc.

Any suggestions and changes are welcome foe the improvement of the code!!
